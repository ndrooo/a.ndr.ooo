Welcome to my web page! Here are some links:

- Some [website-related resources](website-stuff) I've collected for people making personal or hobby websites

## about me
I'm **Andrew**, a software developer and curious person in New York City. For my job I build **websites** and I am particularly focused on making them **accessible**. When I feel like writing software for fun I build **different websites**, dabble in **game development**, mess around with **Unix**, and continuously improve my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/ndrooo/nix).

I am a **gardener** of the home and community variety, I'm a **birder**, and I enjoy learning anything I can about **ecology**. I know a lot about **tea** and I do like to drink it as well. I like **crosswords** and other puzzles, and I'm trying to learn how to make them. I dabble in **electronics and fabrication**. I'm very interested in **home electrification** and **climate tech** as well.

You can contact me at [a@ndr.ooo](mailto:a@ndr.ooo).
