# Andrew Sherman

I'm **Andrew**, a software developer and curious person in New York City. For my job I build **websites** and I am particularly focused on making them **accessible**. When I feel like writing software for fun I build **different websites**, dabble in **game development**, mess around with **Unix**, and continuously improve my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/ndrooo/nix).

I am a **gardener** at my community garden and at home. I'm interested in **ecology**, particularly of plants and trees. I know a lot about **tea** and I like to drink it too. I dabble in **electronics and fabrication** and have built a few keyboards and some smaller projects. I'm very interested in **home electrification** and **climate tech**.

You can contact me at [a@ndr.ooo](mailto:a@ndr.ooo).
