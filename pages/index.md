# Andrew Sherman

Welcome to my website! Here are some things I'm working on:

<lines-list>

- Some [website-related resources](/website-stuff) I've collected for people making personal or hobby websites
- **(Under construction)** A [web accessibility audit](/a11y-audit) for beginners, to catch the biggest access issues in your hobby website

</lines-list>

## about me
I'm **Andrew**, a software developer and curious person in New York City. For my job I build **websites** and I am particularly focused on making them **accessible**. When I feel like writing software for fun I build **different websites**, dabble in **game development**, mess around with **Unix**, and continuously improve my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/ndrooo/nix).

I am a **gardener** at my community garden and at home. I'm interested in **ecology**, particularly of plants and trees. I know a lot about **tea** and I like to drink it too. I dabble in **electronics and fabrication** and have built a few keyboards and some smaller projects. I'm very interested in **home electrification** and **climate tech**.

You can contact me at [a@ndr.ooo](mailto:a@ndr.ooo).
