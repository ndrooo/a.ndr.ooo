# NYC ephemera

I've been living in New York for three decades and I keep learning **miscellaneous interesting stuff** - I figured I should put some of it here.

## Advertising

What are those **strange ads** you've been seeing around town?
- The story behind [those subway ads about philosophy](https://theoutline.com/post/6889/school-of-practical-philosophy-philosophy-works-new-york-subway-ad?zr=dmxmsh5j&zd=3&zi=oeo664tk)
- How about the ["Keano" flyers with the freaky eye](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/nyregion/keano-spiritual-consultant.html)?
- [Dan Smith Will Teach You Guitar](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/an-exclusive-interview-with-mystery-man-dan-smith-who-will-teach-you-guitar)
- [Etti-Cat](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/this-cat-was-the-nyc-subway-etiquette-mascot-in-the-1960s) was the adorable representative of Subway etiquette in the 60s

## Nature

Explore the trees around you with the [NYC Tree Map](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/)! If animals excite you more, you might be interested to know there's a (somewhat defunct) [Squirrel Census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/). The city's fungus is studied by the [New York Mycological Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mycological_Society), which once counted composer John Cage as a member.

## Weird history
- [The pilot who landed on 191st street](https://archive.nytimes.com/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/long-ago-a-pilot-landed-on-an-uptown-street-thats-where-the-bar-was/)
- [The Subway Garnet](https://www.diamondoodles.com/blog/the-famous-new-york-subway-garnet) - a giant gem discovered under 35th street by a worker digging a sewer tunnel
